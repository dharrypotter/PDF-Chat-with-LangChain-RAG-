# RAG-based Chat Application for PDF Interactions using LangChain

This repository provides a solution for building a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based chat application that allows users to interact with the content of PDF documents. Powered by **LangChain**, this application leverages state-of-the-art language models to retrieve and generate responses based on the contents of the uploaded PDFs.

## Features

- Upload PDF documents and ask questions related to the content.
- Retrieve relevant information from PDFs and generate human-like responses.
- Utilize **LangChain** and **OpenAI** to build a powerful retrieval-augmented generation system.
- Supports various techniques such as **FAISS** for fast document retrieval and **PyPDF2** for PDF parsing.
